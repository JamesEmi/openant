Automatic install
-----------------

- Install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools):
 
        apt-get install python-setuptools
or

        wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python

- Run the following command:

        sudo python setup.py install

This will install everything required on your active python installation.


Manual install
--------------

These should only be necessary to install manually, if you don't want to use the Automatic installation script.

- Install [PyUSB](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb).

        pip install pyusb

    *(Or alternatively from [sources available on GitHub](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb))*

- Install [udev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) rules (Only required to avoid running the program as root).

        sudo python setup.py udev_rules


## Windows install
--------------

Windows does not use udev_rules and therefore does not need to be installed. The installation of udev_rules is bypassed for Windows. libusb is supported by Windows. Follow libusb's driver installation [instructions](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#Driver_Installation) for Windows. 

- Install [PyUSB](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb).

        pip install pyusb

    *(Or alternatively from [sources available on GitHub](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb))*

- Install [libusb](https://github.com/karpierz/libusb).

        pip install libusb

    *(Or alternatively from [sources available on GitHub](https://github.com/karpierz/libusb))*

## Supported devices

### ANT-FS Devices

Any compliant ANT-FS device should in theory work, but those specific devices have been reported as working:

 - Garmin Forerunner 60
 - Garmin Forerunner 405CX
 - Garmin Forerunner 310XT
 - Garmin Forerunner 610
 - Garmin Forerunner 910XT
 - Garmin FR70
 - Garmin Swim
 - Garmin vÃ­voactive HR

Please let me know if you have any success with devices that are not listed here.

## InfluxDB CLI Tool

Stream DeviceData from a ANT+ device to a InfluxDB instance. Useful for plotting real-time data and for post review.

Requires install with [influx] (`pip install openant[influx]`) or influxdb-client module installed manually and InfluxDB server >= 2.0. See `openant influx --help` for the server setup. To quickly get a local instance running with Docker:

```
docker run --rm -p 8086:8086 \
      -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb2 \
      influxdb:latest
```

Navigate to 'http://localhost:8086' and setup a user/org (default org used is 'my-org'). Then setup a bucket to use (default 'my-bucket') and a API access token (Load Data > API Tokens).
